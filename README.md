Qtune-VISAR
=============
Qtune-VISAR is a web conferencing system.  
Qtune-VISAR supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard controls), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.  

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed VisarQtune for online learning (though it can be used for many [other applications](http://www.qtune.co.za#industrial)).  The educational use cases for Visar-Qtune are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)

You can install on a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server.  We provide [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) to let you have a server up and running within 30 minutes (or your money back :-).
